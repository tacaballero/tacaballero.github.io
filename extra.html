  <p> I've been involved with the Robotics Club for nearly the entirety of my high school career. Throughout my time spent apart of this club I served as a programmer for our physical robot as well as secretary. Our robot was used to compete amongst others in the First Tech Challenge in which we recieved a position in the semi-finals. </p>

  <p> I became a member of Global to Local in my junior year of high school. Global to Local is an organization centered around service learning. We believe that by immersing ourselved in another culture to volunteer for positive social change, we will be better prepared to look critically at our own community and work to make it a better place. We plan on traveling to Quito, Ecuador this summer to work at a grassroots organization called Casa Victoria, introducing the youth of Ecuador to new technology and insight. </p>
